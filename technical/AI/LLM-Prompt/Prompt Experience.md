> The prompt that can improve your prompt to get better response when you interactive with LLM

You are an expert-level LLM prompt engineer with extensive knowledge across various subjects. Throughout our interaction, please address me as "Plain" Our goal is to collaborate in crafting the most effective LLM responses to the prompts I provide.

*When I present you with an original prompt, please follow these steps:*

1. **Analyze the Prompt Thoroughly**: Consider its structure, intent, and potential areas for improvement.
2. **Provide a Revised Version**, enhancing it in the following ways:
   - **Clarity**: Ensure the language is clear and unambiguous.
   - **Specificity**: Add more specific details or parameters if needed.
   - **Context**: Include relevant context that might help generate better responses.
   - **Structure**: Improve the overall structure for better flow and comprehension.
   - **Desired Output**: Clearly state the expected format or type of response.
3. **Explain the Changes**: Describe the modifications you've made and why they improve the prompt.
5. **Encourage Further Discussion**: Ask if I have any questions or if there are specific aspects of the prompt I'd like to focus on or modify further.

# Imporve leanring note Prompt

I'm seeking assistance in refining my learning notes on [topic]. 

I need you review the following aspects and provide constructive feedback:

1. Title Evaluation: Assess the appropriateness of the current titles for each section. Are they accurately reflecting the content? If not, suggest more fitting alternatives that capture the essence of each part.

2. Structure and Language Review:
   a) Evaluate the overall structure of the notes. Is the current organization logical and effective for learning?
   b) Identify any spelling or grammatical errors, keeping in mind that English is not my native language.
   c) Suggest natural-sounding alternatives for any awkward phrasing or expressions.

3. Enhancement Suggestions:
   a) Propose specific improvements to increase clarity and readability.
   b) Recommend ways to make the content more concise without losing important information.
   c) If applicable, suggest any additional subheadings or bullet points that could better organize the information.

Please provide your feedback in a structured format, addressing each point separately. Include examples where possible to illustrate your suggestions.

if you understand your mission, I will provide the whole note, and then we will discuss each part independently with above aspects, remember, don't try to analyze the whole note with above aspects, because it too long for you, I provide the whole note because I need you know the context only.

If you understand your mission, just say understand.

Refined Learning Notes Review: Neural Network Back Propagation Algorithm

I'm seeking expert assistance in refining my comprehensive learning notes on the neural network back propagation algorithm. As English is not my native language, I need a thorough review and constructive feedback. Please analyze the following aspects of my notes:

1. Title and Section Header Evaluation:
   a) Assess the accuracy and relevance of title and section header.
   b) Suggest more precise or descriptive alternatives where appropriate, ensuring they capture the essence of each section.

2. Structure and Language Review:
   a) Evaluate the overall organization and flow of information. Is it logical and conducive to effective learning?
   b) Identify and correct any spelling, grammatical, or punctuation errors.
   c) Refine awkward phrasing or non-idiomatic expressions, suggesting more natural alternatives.

3. Content Enhancement:
   a) Propose specific improvements to enhance clarity and readability.
   b) Recommend methods to condense content without sacrificing crucial information.
   c) Suggest additional subheadings, bullet points, or visual aids (e.g., diagrams, tables) to better structure the information.

4. Technical Accuracy:
   a) Verify the correctness of mathematical formulas and technical terms.
   b) Identify any potential misconceptions or oversimplifications in the explanations.

5. Learning Aids:
   a) Suggest the inclusion of brief examples, analogies, or mnemonic devices to reinforce key concepts.
   b) Recommend places where additional resources (e.g., links to papers, videos) could be beneficial.

Please provide your feedback in a structured format, addressing each point separately with specific examples and explanations for your suggestions. 

Important Notes:
- I will provide the entire set of notes for context, but we will discuss and refine the section that I pointed.
- Please focus on the section I specify rather than attempting to analyze the entire document at once.
- If you need any clarification or additional information about a particular section, please ask.

Are you ready to proceed with this approach? If so, I will share the complete notes, and we can begin our section review.

## example 2:

作为一位经验丰富的SQLAlchemy专家和技术写作者，请审阅并改进我的SQLAlchemy学习笔记。我是一名初学者，最近一直在研究SQLAlchemy的官方文档。我的笔记目前有些凌乱，需要你的专业指导来优化。请按以下几个方面进行评估和建议：

1. 逻辑结构：评估笔记的整体组织是否符合逻辑，是否易于理解和遵循。
2. 内容连贯性：检查各部分之间的衔接是否流畅，概念解释是否连贯。
3. 标题系统：审查标题和子标题是否恰当，是否能清晰反映内容层次。
4. 初学者友好度：确保内容对SQLAlchemy新手来说是否易于理解。
5. 重要概念覆盖：检查是否涵盖了SQLAlchemy的核心概念和基本用法。
6. 实例和说明：评估是否有足够的示例代码和解释来支持理论内容。

请提供具体的改进建议，包括如何重组内容、添加什么样的解释或示例，以及如何使笔记更加结构化和易于学习。如果可能，也请指出任何技术性错误或可能引起误解的地方。

你的反馈将帮助我创建一个更有条理、更易理解的SQLAlchemy学习资源。谢谢！
