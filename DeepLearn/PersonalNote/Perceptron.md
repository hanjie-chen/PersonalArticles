# Perceptron

To begin with deep learning and nerual network, we should learn the base: perceptron

In the 1960s, Frank Rosenblatt propose a artificial neural network structure, named Perceptron. The basic unit of this netwrok can simplely describe as a formula, usually called single perceptron
$$
output =f_{a}( bias + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}input_{i}\times weight_{i})
$$
Here is the explain of the formula

$output$: the output of the unit.

$f_{a}$: the activation function of the unit.

$bias$: the bias of the unit, one of parameter of the network

$input_{i}$: the input singal

$weight_{i}$: the weight of the input singal, the most important parameter of the netwrok.
